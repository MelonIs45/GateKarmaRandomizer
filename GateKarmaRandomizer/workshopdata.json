  "Description": "[h1]A mod that customises the karma requirements for all gates in Rain World.[/h1]\r\n\r\nI Hope players enjoy this twist!\r\n\r\n[h2]Features (all configurable)[/h2]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [b]Per campaign randomisation[/b], where the gates get randomised once and remain the same for that specific campaign.\r\n[*] [b]Custom seeds[/b], so that you can share any seeds with others to achieve the same randomised gates.\r\n[*] [b]Dynamic randomisation[/b], this makes gate karma random everytime a region is loaded or a game has been continued again.\r\n[*] [b]Region Kit \u002B Karma Expansion[/b], thanks to LazyCowboy for the implementation \u002B map karma fix!\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]Currently Tested With[/h2]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Monk with and without MSC enabled\r\n[*] Very little testing with survivor\r\n[*] MSC, Warp Menu, Remix, Expedition, Music Announcements, Lizard Mlem, DMS all enabled\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]Some Issues[/h2]\r\nNot sure if this is only a monk/survivor only thing because of expedition mode, but since the metropolis/bitter aerie/outer expanse gate is changed, it allows for scugs to get inside (this has only been tested on Monk, but after reading up on the wiki, it seems that it should only work on monk/survivor)\r\n\r\n[h2]Helping/Suggesting[/h2]\r\nIf you have any [b]issues/bugs[/b], either dm me on discord (@meloons) or create an issue on github! (Comments on steam are hard to work with.)\r\n\r\nSame goes for [b]suggestions[/b], however I would prefer those to go on github!\r\n\r\nGithub: https://github.com/MelonIs45/GateKarmaRandomizer\r\nDice art: [url=https://www.freepik.com/free-psd/realistic-casino-items-illustration_58596854.htm#fromView=keyword\u0026page=1\u0026position=2\u0026uuid=78065210-8fc7-4c0c-a3ac-cf1e1b521189]freepik[/url]\r\nFont: [url=https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo\u002B2]Exo 2 Heavy[/url]",
